# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
This report is an analysis into employee data in order to help Bobby’s manager. If he needs to be prepared for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Overview of Project
Our client wants us to look into the employee dataset and find out the following:-

* Determine the number of retiring employees per title.
* Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.


## Results
Lets take a closer look at the analysis and our findings:-

* This table shows us how many people are going to retire and their job titles. A lot of senior engineering position will be open and needs to be filled up.

When we see the table, we can come to these conclusions:-

* Urban cities have the **highest total riders** followed by Suburban and Rural cities.
* The trend continues when it comes to **Total Drivers**, urban cities have the most drivers and rural cities have the least drivers.
* Since the total riders and drivers are the highest in urban cities, they have the **highest Total Fares**. Followed by suburban and rural cities.
* Despite urban cities having the highest total fares, riders and drivers. Their **average fare per ride** is the lowest, followed by suburban and rural cities.
* Interestingly, rural cities have the highest amount when it comes to **average fare per driver**. Followed by suburban and urban cities.


## Summary
A graph to summerize and visualize all our findings:-

Here are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:-

* Rural cities have the least number of drivers, this could be a reason why they have low number of riders. If rural drivers are given better incentives, the total driver count could increase. As a result, the customer base will also increase as it will be easier to get a ride.
* In rural cities, the average fare per ride is much higher then other city types. This could discourage potential customers, if the customers are given discounts or other incentives. This can increase the total riders in rural cities.
* For urban cities, their average fare is very low compared to other city types. This could discourage drivers and the driver count might decrease. If there are lower drivers, it will be harder for customers to get rides. As a result the customers might go to other competitors.
