# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
This report is an analysis into employee data in order to help Bobby’s manager. If he needs to be prepared for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Overview of Project
Our client wants us to look into the employee dataset and find out the following:-

* Determine the number of retiring employees per title.
* Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.


## Results
Lets take a closer look at the analysis and our findings:-

* This table shows us how many people are going to retire and their job titles. A lot of senior engineering position will be open and needs to be filled up.

* This is a [list](https://github.com/tanzimamin2/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retirement_titles.csv) of employees who will be retiring soon. But, there are duplicate entries for some employees because they have switched titles over the years. As such we had to create another list mentioned underneath.

* This is the list of **unique** employees who will be retiring soon according to their titles. The image below is an exerpt from the [full table](https://github.com/tanzimamin2/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/unique_titles.csv)
