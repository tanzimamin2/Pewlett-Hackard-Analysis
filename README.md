Here are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:-

* Rural cities have the least number of drivers, this could be a reason why they have low number of riders. If rural drivers are given better incentives, the total driver count could increase. As a result, the customer base will also increase as it will be easier to get a ride.
* In rural cities, the average fare per ride is much higher then other city types. This could discourage potential customers, if the customers are given discounts or other incentives. This can increase the total riders in rural cities.
* For urban cities, their average fare is very low compared to other city types. This could discourage drivers and the driver count might decrease. If there are lower drivers, it will be harder for customers to get rides. As a result the customers might go to other competitors.
